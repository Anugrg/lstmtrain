# lstmtrain

Script for Master's Thesis on Video Detection of Elderly falls using LSTM on an Embedded Device

The script I used for training an LSTM models on skeleton keypoints acquired using openpose.

The input is a csv file containing rows of x and y coordinates of joints. 
Each row can be considered a temporal instance of a skeleton position of a subject.
